Implement formula (1) from "Estimating Sizes of Social Networks via Biased Sampling". 

Apply it to nodes collected by:
(a) UIS WOR, 
(b) UIS WR, 
(c) WIS WR (with weights equal to node degrees), 
(d) RW (using all nodes, or every k-th node; the weights are node degrees). 

What do you observe?

Where to start?

Each sampling technique is contained in its own file (except UIS_WOR which doesn't make sense since there wont be any collisions). For example, to start a full MHRW sample run: 
     python mhrw_sample.py

UIS_WR and WIS_WR samples are self-contained. Run as:
     python uis_wr.py or python wis_wr.py

RWRW is broken.
